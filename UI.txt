# Vehicle Registration Investor Dashboard

## Overview
This project is an interactive dashboard built in Streamlit that visualizes vehicle registration data from the Vahan public dataset with investor-centric KPIs and visuals. Users can explore vehicle registrations by category and manufacturer, analyze year-over-year (YoY) growth, and filter data by date ranges.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Recommended to use a virtual environment

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd vehicle-registration-investor-dashboard

text

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows

text

3. Install dependencies:
pip install streamlit pandas numpy altair matplotlib

text

### Running the Dashboard

Run the Streamlit app using:
streamlit run ui.py

text

Upload `data/vehicle_registration_dashboard_ready.csv` or your own CSV with compatible schema to begin.



Data Assumptions

- The dataset contains quarterly vehicle registrations with columns:
  - `registration_date`: first day of each quarter (datetime)
  - `period`: Quarter label, e.g., `2023-Q1`
  - `manufacturer`: Vehicle manufacturer names
  - `vehicle_category`: Vehicle class (e.g., Motor Car, Omni Bus)
  - `count`: Number of vehicles registered
- The data covers multiple years to allow YoY and QoQ growth analysis.
- Totals represent the sum of 4WIC, LMV, MMV, and HMV categories implicitly.

## Feature Roadmap (if continued)

- Add additional filters for vehicle type (2W, 3W, etc.) if data available.
- Incorporate predictive analytics or AI-based forecasting for registration trends.
- Enhance UI with more investor-centric insights like market share, region-wise trends.
- Add export options for charts and KPIs in PDF or Excel.
- Deploy the dashboard as a web service for remote stakeholder access.
